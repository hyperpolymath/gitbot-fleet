== Completed (SONNET-TASKS)

All tasks from the initial SONNET-TASKS plan have been completed.

=== [line-through]#Task 0: Scaffold the Repository#

* [x] Clone from RSR template
* [x] Set up Rust project with Cargo.toml
* [x] Configure dependencies (clap, serde, walkdir, regex, tracing, gitbot-shared-context)

=== [line-through]#Task 1: Deprecated Crypto Detection Analyzers (7 analyzers)#

* [x] Hash Function Analyzer (`src/analyzers/hashing.rs`)
* [x] Symmetric Encryption Analyzer (`src/analyzers/symmetric.rs`)
* [x] Key Exchange Analyzer (`src/analyzers/key_exchange.rs`)
* [x] Signature Analyzer (`src/analyzers/signatures.rs`)
* [x] Password Hashing Analyzer (`src/analyzers/password.rs`)
* [x] TLS/Protocol Analyzer (`src/analyzers/protocol.rs`)
* [x] RNG Analyzer (`src/analyzers/rng.rs`)

=== [line-through]#Task 2: Configuration & Dependency Scanning (2 analyzers)#

* [x] Dependency crypto audit (`src/analyzers/deps.rs`)
* [x] Configuration file scanning (`src/analyzers/config.rs`)

=== [line-through]#Task 3: Post-Quantum Readiness Assessment#

* [x] PQ readiness scorer (`src/pq_readiness.rs`) with 0-100 scale
* [x] Migration roadmap generator with 19 standard migration paths

=== [line-through]#Task 4: CLI Interface#

* [x] All 6 subcommands: scan, analyze, report, fleet, pq-readiness, audit-deps
* [x] All 4 bot modes: advisor, consultant, regulator, policy
* [x] Text and JSON output formats
* [x] Verbosity levels

=== [line-through]#Task 5: Fleet Integration#

* [x] BotId registration (Custom(100))
* [x] 6 finding categories
* [x] BotInfo, BotExecution, FindingSet integration
* [x] Mode-aware blocking (regulator/policy fail on errors)

=== [line-through]#Task 6: Policy Engine#

* [x] Bot directive parsing from `.bot_directives/cipherbot.scm`
* [x] Scope and exception list support
* [x] 3 Eclexia policy files

=== [line-through]#Task 7: DNS & Infrastructure Security (2 analyzers)#

* [x] DNS Zone File Analyzer (`src/analyzers/dns.rs`)
* [x] Infrastructure-as-Code Analyzer (`src/analyzers/infra.rs`)

=== [line-through]#Task 8: Ecosystem Integration (design)#

* [x] Hypatia, a2ml, k9-svc, stateful-artefacts, gitbot-fleet interaction design

=== [line-through]#Task 9: Tests#

* [x] 94 tests total (target was 35 minimum)
* [x] Per-analyzer unit tests
* [x] PQ readiness tests
* [x] Integration tests with fixture files
* [x] SARIF serialization tests
* [x] Fleet integration tests
* [x] Policy engine tests
* [x] CLI parsing tests

== Future Work

=== Near-term

* Add tree-sitter AST parsing for deeper code analysis (dependency commented out in Cargo.toml)
* Register `BotId::Cipherbot` upstream in gitbot-shared-context (currently using Custom(100))
* Auto-fix capabilities for simple migrations (e.g., SHA-256 import to SHAKE3-512)
* CI workflow for cipherbot's own test suite

=== Medium-term

* Hypatia integration for cross-repo pattern learning
* robot-repo-automaton integration for automated crypto migrations
* k9-svc contract validation for service-to-service crypto
* VeriSimDB data feed for crypto hygiene metrics
* Formal verification integration (Coq/Isabelle) for crypto primitives

=== Long-term

* Language-specific AST analysis (Rust, JavaScript, Go, Python)
* Certificate chain validation and expiry monitoring
* Runtime crypto audit via instrumentation
* SBOM crypto attestation
