== Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for finishing-bot, the release readiness validation bot for the hyperpolymath gitbot-fleet.

== v1.0 - Production Release (Current)

**Target:** 2026-02
**Status:** Near-complete (98%)

=== Core Analyzers
* [x] License validation (SPDX headers, allowed licenses, disallowed license detection)
* [x] Placeholder detection (TODO, FIXME, XXX, HACK, BUG, UNDONE)
* [x] Claims verification (README completeness, CHANGELOG, feature markers)
* [x] Release artifact checking (version consistency, debug statements, sensitive data, SECURITY.md)
* [x] SCM files validation (all 6 files in `.machine_readable/`, SPDX headers, required sections)
* [x] Testing infrastructure (benchmarks, fuzzing, stress tests)
* [x] Tooling validation (.tool-versions, .editorconfig, CI workflows)
* [x] V1 readiness (docs, security, language compliance, community files)

=== Testing and Quality
* [x] 43 tests total (37 integration, 2 config, 3 fleet, 1 inline)
* [x] ClusterFuzzLite fuzzing (2 targets)
* [x] Criterion benchmarks
* [x] Stress test workflow
* [x] Self-analysis dogfooding (finishingbot analyzes itself)

=== Integration
* [x] gitbot-fleet shared context support (behind `fleet` feature flag)
* [x] Fleet mode CLI subcommand
* [x] BotId::Finishbot registration and dependency tracking
* [x] cicd-hyper-a release rule integration (types and scaffolding)
* [x] JSON and pretty output formats
* [x] CLI with subcommands (audit, fix, license, placeholders, claims, release, init, show, fleet)
* [x] YAML and TOML configuration support
* [x] Auto-fix for license headers and placeholders
* [x] ROADMAP.adoc
* [x] Documentation with usage examples

=== Remaining for v1.0
* [ ] Publish to crates.io
* [ ] End-to-end integration test with live gitbot-fleet context
* [ ] Expand auto-fix capability beyond license/placeholder

== v1.1 - Enhanced Validation (Next)

**Target:** 2026-03

=== New Analyzers
* Security scanning (dependency audit, CVE checking)
* Performance validation (bundle size, build time)
* Documentation quality (link checking, completeness scoring)
* API compatibility checking

=== Improvements
* Enhanced auto-fix for more finding types
* Configurable severity thresholds
* Custom rule definitions
* Parallel analyzer execution for speed

=== Fleet Integration
* Advanced shared context synchronization
* Cross-repo validation rules
* Fleet-wide policy enforcement
* Automated PR creation for fixes

== v1.2 - AI-Assisted Validation

**Target:** 2026-04

=== AI Features
* LLM-based code quality analysis
* Automated suggestion generation
* Natural language finding explanations
* Contextual fix recommendations

=== Advanced Checks
* Semantic versioning compliance
* Breaking change detection
* Migration path validation
* Backwards compatibility verification

== v2.0 - Neurosymbolic Validation

**Target:** 2026-Q3

=== Hypatia Integration
* Logtalk rule-based validation
* Formal verification of release criteria
* Proof-carrying code validation
* Rule synthesis from validation history

=== A2ML Integration
* Attested documentation validation
* Typed markup verification
* Claim provenance tracking
* Verified documentation graphs

=== K9-SVC Integration

* Formal proof generation for release readiness

== v2.5 - Distributed Validation

**Target:** 2026-Q4

=== Architecture
* Distributed analyzer execution
* Peer-to-peer validation network
* Cached validation results
* Incremental validation

=== Performance
* Sub-second validation for large repos
* Parallel multi-repo validation
* Intelligent caching strategies
* Differential validation

== v3.0 - Autonomous Release Management

**Target:** 2027

=== Autonomous Features
* Automatic release candidate creation
* Self-healing validation failures
* Predictive quality analysis
* Autonomous fix generation and testing

=== Ecosystem Intelligence
* Cross-project learning
* Best practice extraction
* Anti-pattern detection
* Quality trend analysis

=== Integration

See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing Guidelines] for how to contribute to finishing-bot development.

== Versioning

finishing-bot follows semantic versioning (SemVer). Breaking changes will only be introduced in major version releases.
