# Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

## Overview

The Garment Sustainability Bot follows the Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF), which establishes graduated trust boundaries for contributions.

## Current Perimeter: **Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)**

This project operates at **Perimeter 3**, meaning:

- ✅ **Fully open** contribution model
- ✅ **Public repository** with open issues and pull requests
- ✅ **Welcoming** to all contributors regardless of experience
- ✅ **Community-driven** development
- ✅ **Transparent** decision-making processes

## TPCF Perimeters Explained

### Perimeter 1: Trusted Core

**Not applicable to this project** - Reserved for projects with formal verification, security-critical code, or strict access control requirements.

**Characteristics:**
- Formal verification required
- Restricted contributor access
- Rigorous review processes
- Often used for critical infrastructure

**Example use cases:**
- Cryptographic libraries
- Safety-critical systems
- Financial transaction systems

### Perimeter 2: Verified Contributors

**Not applicable to this project** - Would require contributor verification and approval process.

**Characteristics:**
- Contributors must be verified/approved
- Code review by maintainers required
- Moderate access control
- Balance between openness and control

**Example use cases:**
- Enterprise software
- Projects with compliance requirements
- Moderate security concerns

### Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox ← **WE ARE HERE**

**Current perimeter for this project**

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Open to all contributors
- ✅ Community-driven development
- ✅ Transparent processes
- ✅ Educational focus
- ✅ Experimental features welcome
- ✅ Learning-friendly environment

**Contribution Model:**

1. **Anyone can**:
   - Fork the repository
   - Submit pull requests
   - Open issues
   - Participate in discussions
   - Suggest features
   - Report bugs

2. **Contributors are**:
   - Welcomed regardless of experience level
   - Encouraged to experiment
   - Supported in learning
   - Recognized for contributions
   - Expected to follow Code of Conduct

3. **Reviews are**:
   - Conducted by maintainers
   - Educational when possible
   - Focused on sustainability mission alignment
   - Open to community feedback
   - Documented in pull requests

## Why Perimeter 3?

This project chose Perimeter 3 because:

1. **Educational Mission**: We want to welcome newcomers to sustainable tech
2. **Community Building**: Open collaboration fosters better sustainability solutions
3. **Transparency**: Sustainability requires open, honest discussion
4. **Innovation**: Best ideas can come from anywhere
5. **Accessibility**: Lower barriers encourage diverse perspectives

## Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. **Read the docs**:
   - README.md for project overview
   - CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution guidelines
   - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for community expectations

2. **Find an issue**:
   - Look for "good first issue" labels
   - Check "help wanted" issues
   - Propose your own ideas

3. **Submit a PR**:
   - Fork and create a feature branch
   - Write tests for your changes
   - Follow code style guidelines
   - Submit pull request with clear description

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks**: CI/CD pipeline runs tests and linting
2. **Maintainer review**: Code review by project maintainers
3. **Community feedback**: Others can comment and suggest improvements
4. **Iteration**: Address feedback and update PR
5. **Merge**: Once approved, maintainer merges

### What We Look For

- **Alignment**: Does it support sustainability mission?
- **Quality**: Is the code well-written and tested?
- **Documentation**: Is it documented and explained?
- **Safety**: Does it maintain security standards?
- **Community**: Does it follow Code of Conduct?

## Trust Building

While we're at Perimeter 3 (fully open), we still build trust:

- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before merge
- **Testing**: Automated tests required
- **Transparency**: Decisions documented
- **Recognition**: Contributors acknowledged
- **Mentorship**: Experienced contributors help newcomers

## Perimeter Evolution

### Could we move to Perimeter 2?

We might consider Perimeter 2 if:
- Project gains enterprise adoption
- Security requirements increase
- Formal verification becomes necessary
- Contributor verification is needed for compliance

**Current assessment**: Perimeter 3 serves us well

### Could we move to Perimeter 1?

Perimeter 1 would require:
- Formal verification of all code
- Strict access controls
- Security-critical nature
- Compliance with safety standards

**Current assessment**: Not applicable for this project

## TPCF Benefits

- **Clear expectations**: Know what level of scrutiny to expect
- **Appropriate process**: Process matches project needs
- **Community fit**: Find projects matching your experience level

### For Maintainers

- **Explicit trust model**: Clear about contribution process
- **Right-sized process**: Not too strict, not too loose
- **Scalable**: Can evolve as project needs change

### For Users

- **Transparency**: Understand how code is vetted
- **Trust signals**: Perimeter indicates review rigor
- **Risk awareness**: Know the contribution model

## Relationship to RSR

TPCF is part of the Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) framework:

- **RSR**: Overall repository standards
- **TPCF**: Contribution and access control model
- **Integration**: TPCF perimeter documented in RSR compliance
