Life happens, and we respect maintainers' time and priorities.

## Decision Making

### Consensus Model

We use lazy consensus for most decisions:

* **Propose**: Post proposal in issue or discussion
* **Wait**: Allow 72 hours for feedback
* **Decide**: If no objections, proceed
* **Override**: Major concerns trigger discussion and vote

### Voting

For major decisions (architecture changes, new dependencies, policy changes):

* **Proposal**: Written proposal with rationale
* **Discussion**: Open discussion period (1 week minimum)
* **Vote**: Maintainers vote (simple majority required)
* **Documentation**: Document decision and rationale

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Discussion**: Try to resolve through discussion
2. **Mediation**: Involve neutral third party if needed
3. **Vote**: Vote if consensus cannot be reached
4. **Escalation**: Refer to Code of Conduct for conduct issues
