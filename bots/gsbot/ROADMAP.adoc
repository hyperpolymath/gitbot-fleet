== Phase 1: Production Readiness

Target: Prepare for public deployment

=== Database & Data

* [ ] Curate initial material dataset (20+ common materials with verified metrics)
* [ ] Curate garment dataset (50+ common garment types)
* [ ] Integrate Good On You API or scrape verified brand data
* [ ] PostgreSQL production configuration
* [ ] Database backup and recovery procedures

=== Deployment

* [ ] Container optimization (multi-stage build, minimal image)
* [ ] Health check endpoints
* [ ] Graceful shutdown handling
* [ ] Kubernetes manifests or docker-compose production config
* [ ] Secret management (Vault, SOPS, or sealed secrets)

=== Observability

* [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
* [ ] Grafana dashboard templates
* [ ] Error tracking (Sentry integration)
* [ ] Command usage analytics

=== Security

* [ ] Rate limiting per user/guild
* [ ] Input sanitization audit
* [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI
* [ ] Bot permission audit (minimal required permissions)

== Phase 2: Data Enrichment

Target: Comprehensive sustainability intelligence

=== External Integrations

* [ ] Good On You API integration for real-time brand ratings
* [ ] Open Apparel Registry integration for supply chain transparency
* [ ] Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database connections
* [ ] Fashion Revolution transparency index data

=== Enhanced Scoring

* [ ] Multi-factor scoring with configurable weights
* [ ] Regional impact variations (production location matters)
* [ ] Seasonal recommendations
* [ ] Price-per-wear calculations

=== New Commands

* [ ] `!lifecycle` - Full garment lifecycle analysis
* [ ] `!certifications` - Explain certification meanings (GOTS, OEKO-TEX, etc.)
* [ ] `!carbon` - Carbon footprint calculator for wardrobe
* [ ] `!supply-chain` - Brand supply chain transparency

== Phase 3: Personalization

Target: Tailored sustainability guidance

=== User Features

* [ ] Wardrobe tracking (what you own)
* [ ] Purchase history logging
* [ ] Personal sustainability dashboard
* [ ] Goal setting and progress tracking
* [ ] Achievement badges beyond ranks

* [ ] New sustainable brand alerts
* [ ] Certification updates for tracked brands

== Phase 4: Community Features

Target: Social sustainability

=== Social Features

* [ ] Clothing swap coordination
* [ ] Guild leaderboards (per server)
* [ ] Community challenges
* [ ] Sustainability streaks
* [ ] Share achievements

=== Content

* [ ] User-submitted garment care tips
* [ ] Community brand reviews
* [ ] Sustainable find sharing
* [ ] Local resource discovery

== Phase 5: Platform Expansion

Target: Multi-platform presence

=== Additional Platforms

* [ ] Slack workspace bot
* [ ] Telegram bot
* [ ] Web dashboard (readonly initially)
* [ ] REST API for third-party integrations

=== Advanced Features

* [ ] Image recognition for garment identification
* [ ] Receipt/tag OCR for material composition
* [ ] ML-powered recommendations
* [ ] Natural language queries

== Architecture Migration Notes

The current Python implementation uses:

* discord.py (async Discord interactions)
* SQLAlchemy (ORM)
* SQLite (development database)
* pytest (testing)

Per project language policy (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`), future development should consider:

* **ReScript** for bot logic (compiles to JS, type-safe)
* **Deno** runtime (replaces Node.js ecosystem)
* **Rust** for performance-critical services or WASM modules
* **Gleam** for backend services (BEAM or JS compilation)

Migration path:

1. Stabilize current Python implementation for production
2. Create Deno-based bot using Discord API directly (no discord.py equivalent needed)
3. Port business logic to ReScript modules
4. Extract scoring algorithms to Rust WASM for cross-platform use
5. Deprecate Python codebase

== Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development guidelines.

Priority areas for contribution:

1. **Data curation** - Verified material and brand datasets
2. **Testing** - Expand integration test coverage
3. **Documentation** - User guides and command examples
4. **Localization** - Multi-language support
