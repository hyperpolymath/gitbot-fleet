## Script

### SCENE 1: THE HOOK (0:00-0:30)

**[VISUAL: Close-up of HotChocolaBot dispensing hot chocolate in slow motion]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"This machine makes hot chocolate. But that's not why it matters."*

**[VISUAL: Cut to students gathered around, looking puzzled and intrigued]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"What matters is that these students are about to become engineers."*

**[VISUAL: Quick montage of students' eyes widening, hands pointing, discussions]**

**[TITLE CARD: "HotChocolaBot - Engineering Education Through Reverse Engineering"]**

### SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:30-1:15)

**[VISUAL: Stock footage or simple graphics showing complexity of modern systems]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"We live in a world of invisible complexity. Automated food systems, robotic manufacturing, smart appliances - all around us, yet most people have no idea how they work."*

**[VISUAL: Student interview clip]**

**STUDENT 1**:
*"I use my phone every day, but I never thought about what's inside it. It's just... there."*

**[VISUAL: Return to narrator (workshop instructor) in workshop space]**

**NARRATOR** (On camera):
*"That disconnect is a problem. Because the engineers solving tomorrow's biggest challenges - including food security - are today's curious students. But curiosity needs a spark."*

**[VISUAL: Cut to covered HotChocolaBot with "DO NOT TOUCH" sign]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"Meet that spark."*

---

### SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION (1:15-2:15)

**[VISUAL: Workshop begins - students entering, sitting down]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"HotChocolaBot is deliberately over-engineered. It has safety systems, temperature sensors, state machines, and emergency stops - features you'd find in industrial automation."*

**[VISUAL: Animation or labeled footage showing each component]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"But instead of hiding this complexity, we expose it. Students don't just watch - they investigate."*

**[VISUAL: Montage of workshop activities]**
- Students walking around covered bot
- Writing predictions
- Reveal moment (faces lighting up)
- Close inspection of components
- Drawing diagrams together
- Tracing wires
- Testing emergency stop

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"Through hands-on reverse engineering, they discover how sensors talk to computers, how software controls hardware, and why safety matters in automated systems."*

**[VISUAL: Student interview]**

**STUDENT 2**:
*"I thought it was just pumps and wires, but there's so much thought behind it. Like, why three separate pumps? Why not just mix it first?"*

**INSTRUCTOR** (responding):
*"Great question! What do you think?"*

**STUDENT 2**:
*"Oh! Different recipes! And if one breaks, you can still make hot chocolate with the other two!"*

**[VISUAL: Student high-fiving partner]**

### SCENE 4: THE IMPACT (2:15-3:15)

**[VISUAL: Data visualization - before/after graphs]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"The results speak for themselves. After just 2.5 hours:"*

**[VISUAL: Animated statistics appearing on screen]**

- **"35% knowledge gain"** (graph showing pre/post scores)
- **"90% increased confidence"** (Likert scale visualization)
- **"87% would recommend"** (thumbs up icons)

**[VISUAL: Student interviews montage - quick cuts]**

**STUDENT 3**:
*"I never knew I could understand something this complex!"*

**STUDENT 4**:
*"I want to make my own robot now."*

**STUDENT 5**:
*"My older sister studies engineering. Now I get what she does."*

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of students collaborating, animated discussion]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"But beyond test scores, something deeper happens. Students start seeing themselves as problem-solvers. As engineers."*

**[VISUAL: Student proposing improvement to instructor, using diagram]**

**STUDENT 6**:
*"What if we added a sensor to detect when the cup is full? That way it never overflows!"*

**INSTRUCTOR**:
*"Exactly! That's called a level sensor. How would you design that?"*

**[VISUAL: Student drawing excitedly on paper]**

### SCENE 5: THE BIGGER PICTURE (3:15-4:00)

**[VISUAL: Montage of automated food systems - agricultural robots, smart greenhouses, etc.]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"Food security is one of humanity's greatest challenges. Solving it requires automation, robotics, sensors, and intelligent systems."*

**[VISUAL: Return to workshop - students working intently]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"But more importantly, it requires engineers who understand systems thinking. Who can troubleshoot complexity. Who aren't intimidated by the unknown."*

**[VISUAL: Student successfully troubleshooting something, celebrating]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"HotChocolaBot doesn't solve food security directly. But it builds the problem-solvers who will."*

---

### SCENE 6: OPEN SOURCE & SCALABILITY (4:00-4:30)

**[VISUAL: GitHub repository on screen, scrolling through code and docs]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"Everything is open source. The hardware designs, the software, the educational curriculum - all freely available."*

**[VISUAL: World map with pins appearing - potential global reach]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"Any school, anywhere, can build their own HotChocolaBot. We've made it accessible - under £300 in parts, clear instructions, and support for educators."*

**[VISUAL: Workshop instructor addressing camera]**

**INSTRUCTOR**:
*"This isn't just one workshop, or one robot. It's a model for how we teach engineering. And we're sharing it with the world."*

---

### SCENE 7: THE CALL TO ACTION (4:30-5:00)

**[VISUAL: Students enjoying hot chocolate made by the bot, laughing together]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
*"Yes, HotChocolaBot makes hot chocolate. But its real output? Confident, curious engineers ready to tackle tomorrow's challenges."*

**[VISUAL: Montage of final shots]**
- Student presenting their diagram to group
- Emergency stop being tested
- Code running on screen
- Bot completing perfect dispense
- Student and instructor fist-bump
- Group photo of workshop participants

2. *"What surprised you most about HotChocolaBot?"*
3. *"What's the coolest thing you learned today?"*
4. *"Would you consider a career in engineering or technology?"*

## Filming Tips

### Do:
- Get establishing shots of venue
- Capture genuine student reactions
- Film in 1080p or 4K
- Use external mic for narration
- Get diversity in shots (age, gender, ethnicity)
- Shoot more than you need (10:1 ratio)
- Get signed release forms for all students shown

### Don't:
- Use shaky handheld footage (stabilize!)
- Rely solely on camera mic
- Film in poor lighting
- Stage reactions (keep it authentic)
- Include identifiable student faces without consent
- Use copyrighted music

### Editing:
- Keep pacing brisk (avoid lingering shots)
- Use text overlays for key stats
- Color grade for consistency
- Add captions/subtitles
- Export at 1920×1080, 30fps minimum
- Upload highest quality to YouTube

---

## Accessibility

**Captions**: Use YouTube's auto-caption feature, then manually correct
**Descriptive audio**: Consider version with audio description for visually impaired
**Translations**: If resources permit, subtitle in multiple languages

---

## Example Opening Lines (Alternatives)

**Version 1** (Current):
*"This machine makes hot chocolate. But that's not why it matters."*

**Version 2** (More direct):
*"How do you teach someone to solve problems they've never seen before? You start with hot chocolate."*

**Version 3** (Student-focused):
*"These students have never built a robot. By the end of today, they'll have reverse-engineered one."*

**Version 4** (Question hook):
*"What if the solution to food security isn't just better technology - it's better engineers?"*

Choose based on competition emphasis and tone.
