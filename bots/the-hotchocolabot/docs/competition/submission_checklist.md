## Competition Alignment Strategy

### Challenge: Food Security Theme vs. Educational Focus

**Our Approach**: Frame HotChocolaBot as educational infrastructure for food systems

**Key Messages**:
1. **Skills Development**: Training future food systems engineers
2. **STEM Pipeline**: Building technical capacity in underserved communities
3. **Automation Understanding**: Teaching principles applicable to food production
4. **Systems Thinking**: Essential for solving complex food security challenges

**Application Framing**:
> "While HotChocolaBot dispenses hot chocolate, its true innovation lies in teaching students the engineering principles behind automated food systems. By reverse-engineering this over-designed dispenser, students develop systems thinking skills essential for addressing food security through technology and automation."

### Judging Criteria Alignment

**Innovation** (Expected criterion):
- Heutagogic learning approach (student-directed)
- Over-engineering as pedagogy
- CNO safety principles demonstration
- Open-source, replicable design

**Impact** (Expected criterion):
- Pre/post assessment data showing knowledge gain
- Confidence increase in STEM fields
- Workshop reach (30-50+ students target)
- Open repository enables global replication

**Technical Excellence** (Expected criterion):
- Rust-based safety-critical system
- Formal verification concepts (state machine)
- Professional engineering practices
- Hardware abstraction for portability

**Sustainability** (Expected criterion):
- Open-source model enables ongoing use
- Educational materials freely available
- Partnerships with schools/makerspaces
- Potential for curriculum integration
