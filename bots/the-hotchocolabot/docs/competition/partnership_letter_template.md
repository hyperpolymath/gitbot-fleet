To Whom It May Concern,

Re: Letter of Support for HotChocolaBot Educational Robotics Initiative

I am writing to request a letter of support from [School Name] for our HotChocolaBot
educational robotics project, which we are submitting to the Robotics for Good Youth
Challenge 2025-2026.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

HotChocolaBot is an open-source educational robotics platform designed to teach reverse
engineering and systems thinking to students aged 12-18. Through hands-on workshops,
students investigate an over-engineered hot chocolate dispenser to learn about:

• Embedded systems and hardware-software integration
• Safety-critical system design
• Sensors, actuators, and control systems
• Engineering decision-making and trade-offs

OUR PARTNERSHIP:

We have successfully delivered [NUMBER] workshops at [School Name] between [DATES],
reaching [NUMBER] students in [YEAR GROUPS]. The workshops demonstrated measurable
impact:

• [XX]% average knowledge gain (pre/post assessment)
• [XX]% of students reported increased confidence in STEM subjects
• [XX]% would recommend the workshop to peers

LETTER OF SUPPORT REQUEST:

For our competition submission, we require a letter of support from [School Name]
confirming:

1. That we delivered workshops at your institution
2. The number of students who participated
3. Your assessment of the educational value
4. Your willingness to host future workshops

A template is provided on the next page for your convenience, though you are welcome
to write in your own words.

COMPETITION DEADLINE: April 1, 2026
LETTER NEEDED BY: March 15, 2026

We believe this partnership demonstrates the value of hands-on robotics education and
would strengthen both our submission and [School Name]'s commitment to innovative STEM
teaching.

Thank you for considering this request. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Re: Letter of Support for HotChocolaBot Project by [Your Organization]

Dear Selection Committee,

I am writing to express [School Name]'s strong support for the HotChocolaBot
educational robotics project developed by [Your Organization/Team Name].

Between [DATES], [Your Organization] delivered [NUMBER] HotChocolaBot workshops to
our students in [YEAR GROUPS], reaching a total of [NUMBER] participants. The
workshops were held in our [LOCATION] and integrated with our [SUBJECT] curriculum.

The educational impact was significant:

• Students demonstrated clear understanding of complex engineering concepts
• Pre/post assessments showed [XX]% average knowledge gain
• Student engagement was exceptionally high
• Teachers observed increased confidence in technical problem-solving
• Several students expressed new interest in engineering careers

What impressed us most was the hands-on, discovery-based approach. Rather than
lecturing, the facilitators guided students to reverse-engineer the system
themselves. This heutagogic methodology aligned perfectly with our educational
philosophy of student-centered learning.

The HotChocolaBot platform is particularly valuable because:

1. It makes abstract engineering concepts tangible
2. It demonstrates the importance of safety in automated systems
3. It exposes students to professional engineering practices
4. It is accessible to students with varying technical backgrounds

[School Name] would welcome the opportunity to host future HotChocolaBot workshops
and would recommend this program to other educational institutions.

Please feel free to contact me if you require additional information.

Sincerely,

[Name]

• Approximate number of participants
• Your observations on educational impact
• Your support for the project

DETAILS OF OUR PARTNERSHIP:

Workshop Dates: [LIST DATES]
Total Participants: [NUMBER] (ages [RANGE])
Format: [DESCRIPTION, e.g., "Saturday morning STEM club sessions"]

COMPETITION CONTEXT:

The Robotics for Good Youth Challenge recognizes projects that use robotics for
educational and social impact. Our HotChocolaBot project teaches students reverse
engineering and systems thinking through hands-on investigation.

YOUR SUPPORT MATTERS:

Letters from community partners demonstrate that our project has real-world impact
beyond the lab. Your letter would strengthen our submission and help us potentially
secure recognition that could bring more resources for future workshops.

DEADLINE: March 15, 2026

I've attached a suggested template, but please feel free to write in your own voice.
Authenticity is what matters most.

Thank you for being an essential partner in making STEM education accessible!

[Makerspace/Community Center Letterhead]

[Date]

To: Robotics for Good Youth Challenge Selection Committee

Re: Support for HotChocolaBot Educational Initiative

[Makerspace Name] is pleased to support the HotChocolaBot project by
[Your Organization].

As a community makerspace dedicated to accessible technology education, we hosted
[NUMBER] HotChocolaBot workshops in [DATES]. These workshops served [NUMBER] young
people from our community, many from underserved backgrounds with limited access to
STEM programs.

The workshops were exceptional in several ways:

• Hands-on, discovery-based learning (not passive lectures)
• Accessible to beginners with no prior robotics experience
• Open-source approach aligned with our community values
• Professional equipment and clear educational structure
• Measurable impact on participant confidence and knowledge

Participants consistently reported that the experience changed how they think about
technology. Several have since returned to our makerspace to work on their own
robotics projects - a clear indicator of sparked interest.

We believe HotChocolaBot represents the kind of innovative, accessible STEM education
our community needs. [Makerspace Name] fully supports this submission and would be
eager to host future workshops.

Sincerely,

## Legal/Ethical Considerations

**Authenticity**: Letters must be genuine. Do not fabricate partnerships.

**Transparency**: If you drafted a template, partner should edit it to reflect their authentic voice.

**Permissions**: Ensure partner is comfortable with their letter being shared with competition judges.

**Acknowledgment**: Publicly thank partners (in video credits, final report, etc.)
