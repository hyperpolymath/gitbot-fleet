== Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for glambot, the presentation quality enforcer for the Hyperpolymath gitbot fleet.

== v1.0 - Production Release (Current)

**Target:** 2026-02 +
**Status:** Core complete (85%)

=== Core Analyzers
* [x] Visual Polish (README, badges, line length, logos)
* [x] Accessibility (WCAG alt-text, headings, links)
* [x] SEO (meta tags, OpenGraph, keywords)
* [x] Machine-Readability (JSON/YAML, structured data, .machine_readable/)
* [x] Git-SEO Integration (external git-seo CLI, forge-based scoring)

=== Features
* [x] Full CLI with subcommands (audit, fix, visual, accessibility, seo, machine, init, show)
* [x] Configuration system (YAML/TOML)
* [x] JSON and pretty output formats
* [x] Dry-run mode
* [x] Individual analyzer commands
* [x] Auto-fix mode flag

=== Auto-Fix Implementation
* [x] Visual: README.adoc template creation, badge insertion, screenshot placeholder
* [x] Accessibility: alt text placeholders, lang attribute, WCAG checklist generation
* [x] SEO: description placeholders, topic suggestions, OpenGraph template
* [x] Machine: .machine_readable/ directory scaffolding, SCM templates, JSON-LD template, robots.txt
* [x] Git-SEO: .gitattributes optimization, FUNDING.yml generation

=== Testing & Quality
* [x] 26 unit tests across 6 modules
* [x] 5 integration tests
* [x] Criterion benchmarks (4 suites)
* [x] 2 fuzz targets
* [x] Clippy clean
* [x] SPDX headers on all source files

=== Fleet Integration
* [x] BotId::Glambot with shared-context interop
